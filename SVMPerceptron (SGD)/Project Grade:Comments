Hey dear Nikita:

Your grade for HW4 - perceptron & SVM is as follows, please check the following feedback. In case you have any problem, please feel free to stop by my office during the TA hour.

*********** Feedback *****************

Grade total: 120/140
Detailed breakdown:
*Implementation(70/90)
  **Use stochastic gradient in both methods: run for multiple iterations, one point at a time (preferable with shuffling).(10/10)
  **Correct update rule for perceptron(20/20)
  **Correct update rule for SVM (w and b)(10/20)
  **Correct tuning using development set(20/20)
  **Descent accuracy for both algorithms(10/20)
*Documentation(40/40)
  **Report how performance on dev varies as a function of C, report best accuracy on test(10/10)
  **Interpretation about perceptron algorithm(10/10)
  **Interpretation about SVM algorithm(10/10)
  **Other parts(10/10)
*Code(10/10)
  **Readable code(5/5)
  **Necessary comments(5/5)


For perceptron, it's better use learning rate of 1 or constant. For SVM, you should update b with a learning rate. The performance of your perceptron and SVM is not good enough.

Best,
