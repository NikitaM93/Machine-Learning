Hey dear Nikita:

Your grade for HW3 - naive bayes is as follows, please check the following feedback. In case you have any problem, please feel free to stop by my office during the TA hour.

*********** Feedback *****************

Grade total: 90/100
Detailed breakdown:
*Implementation(50/60)
  **Initialize counts(20/20)
  **Normalization with uniform alpha(10/20)
  **Evaluation with different alphas(20/20)
*Documentation(30/30)
  **Plot classification error on the dev as a function of alpha, report best accuracy on test(10/10)
  **Interpretation about naive bayes algorithm(10/10)
  **Other parts(10/10)
*Code(10/10)
  **Readable code(5/5)
  **Necessary comments(5/5)


There is one error in your equation. The number of alphas in the denominator should be 2 instead of the number of feature dimensions.

Best,
Xiaochang
